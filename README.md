* Hardware:

Temperature Sensors: One or more temperature sensors (e.g., DS18B20) are connected to a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP32) to measure temperature at different locations.
Microcontroller Board: An Arduino or ESP32 microcontroller board is used to interface with the temperature sensors, collect temperature data, and transmit it to the Firebase Realtime Database.
LCD Display: A liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, controlled by the microcontroller, is used to display real-time temperature data and other relevant information.
* Software:

Mobile Application: The Android mobile application is developed using Java and the Android SDK. It serves as the user interface for accessing temperature data retrieved from the Firebase Realtime Database.
Firebase Realtime Database: Firebase is used as the backend database service to store and retrieve temperature data. The microcontroller sends temperature data to the Firebase Realtime Database, and the mobile application retrieves and displays this data to the user.
Firebase Authentication: Firebase Authentication may be used to authenticate users and secure access to temperature data.
Firebase Cloud Functions (Optional): Firebase Cloud Functions can be used to implement server-side logic for processing temperature data or triggering actions based on certain conditions.
Key Features:

Real-time Temperature Monitoring: The system continuously monitors temperature data from multiple sensors in real-time.
Mobile Access: Users can access temperature data from anywhere using the Android mobile application.
User Authentication: Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access temperature data.
Easy Installation: The hardware components are easy to install and configure, making the system suitable for both residential and commercial applications.
Scalability: The system can be easily scaled to accommodate additional sensors and users as needed.
With the "Temperature Monitoring and Display System," users can effectively monitor temperature variations in their environment and take appropriate actions as necessary.
